# SAT Vocabulary RAG System - Comprehensive Requirements & Features Analysis

## Project Overview

The SAT Vocabulary RAG System is an AI-powered application that generates authentic Gulotta-style vocabulary entries using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system learns from user feedback to continuously improve generation quality and provides an API-first architecture for vocabulary education.
